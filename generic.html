							<h1 class="major">Scaling Peer-to-Peer Learning at Shopify</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p><h3>Background</h3>
								<p>At <strong>Shopify</strong>, a rapidly growing e-commerce platform, I was tasked with scaling peer-to-peer learning. With engineers already informally sharing knowledge through initiatives like lunch-and-learns and Slack discussions, the challenge was to formalize and expand these efforts without overburdening teams. Recognizing the limitations of building a custom tool from scratch, they decided to adopt <strong>PlusPlus</strong>, a peer-to-peer learning platform developed by an external vendor. This approach allowed Shopify to implement a scalable, effective learning solution while focusing on core business priorities.</p>
								<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
								<p>As Shopify grew quickly, the company faced a significant challenge in scaling its internal learning and knowledge-sharing initiatives. Engineers were already engaging in informal learning through spontaneous sessions and discussions, but there was no structured, scalable system in place to manage and support these efforts. Without a formal tool or process, the risk was that valuable knowledge could remain siloed, impacting employee development, collaboration, and overall productivity. Additionally, building a custom solution to address these needs would require significant time and resources that were not readily available due to the company&apos;s rapid growth.</p>
								<h3>Objectives</h3>
								<p>The main objectives were to:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Support peer-to-peer learning</strong> across Shopify by providing a scalable tool.</li>
									<li><strong>Empower engineers</strong> to share their expertise and improve knowledge transfer.</li>
									<li><strong>Reduce barriers</strong> to learning by offering training for employees to facilitate knowledge-sharing.</li>
									<li><strong>Gather data</strong> to inform decisions about learning topics and program effectiveness.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Tasks</h3>
								<p>Implementing a phased approach:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Tool Selection</strong>: Rather than building a new tool, they chose PlusPlus to meet Shopify&apos;s needs while partnering with the vendor for customization.</li>
									<li><strong>Focus on Early Adopters</strong>: They worked closely with enthusiastic employees to pilot the tool, creating a core group of ambassadors who helped spread adoption across teams.</li>
									<li><strong>Facilitate Learning</strong>: They provided training for employees to improve their teaching and facilitation skills, helping to create a structured, impactful learning experience.</li>
									<li><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong>: They tracked usage data to refine the program and ensure it aligned with business goals and employee interests.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Impact</h3>
								<p>The initiative had several key outcomes:</p>
								<ol>
									<li><strong>Increased Knowledge Transfer</strong>: Engineers were able to share practical, context-rich insights with colleagues, improving internal learning.</li>
									<li><strong>Scalable Learning Ecosystem</strong>: PlusPlus enabled Shopify to scale peer-to-peer learning efficiently, meeting the needs of both engineers and non-engineers.</li>
									<li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions</strong>: Insights from usage data allowed the team to tailor learning content to the most relevant and impactful topics.</li>
									<li><strong>Enhanced Employee Engagement</strong>: The program fostered a culture of collaboration and continuous learning, leading to higher engagement and retention among employees.</li>
