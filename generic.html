							<h1 class="major">Scaling Peer-to-Peer Learning at Shopify</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic01.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p><h3>Background</h3>
								<p>At <strong>Shopify</strong>, a rapidly growing e-commerce platform, I was tasked with scaling peer-to-peer learning. With engineers already informally sharing knowledge through initiatives like lunch-and-learns and Slack discussions, the challenge was to formalize and expand these efforts without overburdening teams. Recognizing the limitations of building a custom tool from scratch, they decided to adopt <strong>PlusPlus</strong>, a peer-to-peer learning platform developed by an external vendor. This approach allowed Shopify to implement a scalable, effective learning solution while focusing on core business priorities.</p>
								
								<h3>Project Goals</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Support peer-to-peer learning across Shopify by providing a scalable tool.</li>
									<li>Empower engineers to share their expertise and improve knowledge transfer.</li>
									<li>Reduce barriers to learning by offering training for employees to facilitate knowledge-sharing.</li>
									<li>Gatherdata to inform decisions about learning topics and program effectiveness.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>My Tasks</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Designed a plan to implement Plus Plus, a peer-to-peer learning platform.</li>
									<li>Created facilitator guides, activity sheets, and slide decks to support training sessions.</li>
									<li>Provided training to employees to improve their facilitation skills and engagement in learning activities.</li>
									<li>Collected feedback and data to refine learning materials and ensure continuous improvement.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Impact</h3>
								<p>The initiative had several key outcomes:</p>
									<li><strong>Increased Knowledge Transfer</strong>: Engineers were able to share practical, context-rich insights with colleagues, improving internal learning.</li>
									<li><strong>Scalable Learning Ecosystem</strong>: PlusPlus enabled Shopify to scale peer-to-peer learning efficiently, meeting the needs of both engineers and non-engineers.</li>
									<li><strong>Data-Driven Decisions</strong>: Insights from usage data allowed the team to tailor learning content to the most relevant and impactful topics.</li>
									<li><strong>Enhanced Employee Engagement</strong>: The program fostered a culture of collaboration and continuous learning, leading to higher engagement and retention among employees.</li>

							<p><h3>Background</h3>
								<p>At the Ontario Nurse Practitioner Program, I was responsible for supporting faculty and students with educational technology, maintaining the learning management system (LMS), and introducing new technological tools to enhance teaching and learning experiences. This role involved developing resources, researching best practices, and evaluating e-learning products. Faculty and students required better guidance and support for utilizing educational technology in both blended and face-to-face learning environments. Additionally, there was a need to improve course revisions and ensure the effectiveness of e-learning tools.</p>
								<h3>Project Objectives</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Develop job aids and tutorials for educational tools.</li>
									<li>Conduct research on best practices for blended and face-to-face learning and share insights with faculty.</li>
									<li>Provide continuous faculty support through training sessions, workshops, and needs assessments.</li>
						
								</ol>
								<h3>Tasks</h3>
									<li>Created tutorials on using tools like Camtasia, Studio 8, and SharePoint, in both French and English.</li>
									<li>Researched and published bi-weekly blog posts on blended learning strategies.</li>
									<li>Developed an online blended orientation session for incoming students using Camtasia Studio 8.</li>
									<li>Conducted monthly "learn and lunch" sessions to introduce new technological tools to faculty.</li>
									<li>Delivered workshops on Camtasia Studio 8 and provided ongoing faculty support through job aids and training.</li>

								</ol>
								<h3>Impact</h3>
									<li>Enhanced faculty proficiency in using educational tools, leading to more efficient course design and delivery.</li>
									<li>Increased faculty engagement with blended learning strategies, resulting in improved student learning experiences.</li>
									<li>Streamlined student onboarding through the development of a blended orientation session.</li>
									<li>Fostered a culture of continuous improvement and collaboration between faculty and the e-learning team.</li>

							<h1 class="major">Designing Engaging and Accessible E-Learning Experiences for Diverse Learners in moocs</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p><h3>Background</h3>
								<p> Carleton University's Department of Psychology offers an Open Access Course (MOOC) available to all students at no cost. Students wishing to earn academic credit must transfer to a Flex Term section, which includes additional academic and financial requirements. I was responsible for creating e-learning materials for both credit and non-credit versions of the course, with a focus on accessibility and engagement.I was responsible for creating e-learning materials for both credit and non-credit courses, including moocs (massive open online courses) that catered to a diverse, global student population. There was a need to design engaging and accessible e-learning materials for a diverse range of students, including those enrolled in the free Open Access version and those pursuing academic credit through the Flex Term section. The challenge was to create content that was both scalable for large audiences and customizable for students seeking academic credit.</p>
								<h3>Objectives</h3>
								<p>The main objectives were to:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Conduct needs analysis to understand learner requirements for both non-credit and credit courses.</li>
									<li>Develop interactive, engaging, and accessible online learning modules for 2,000 users</li>
									<li>Collaborate with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define learning objectives and create structured, media-rich content.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Tasks</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>Designed interactive, multimedia-rich learning modules using Articulate Storyline, ensuring accessibility and engagement for diverse learners.</li>
									<li>Collaborated with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to define learning objectives and ensure content was relevant and effective.</li>
									<li>Collaborated with SMEs and stakeholders to define course objectives, create learning unit outlines, and develop detailed storyboards.</li>
									<li>Managed on-time delivery of projects by working closely with cross-functional teams and using lean design principles, such as rapid prototyping, iterative testing, and feedback integration.</li>
								</ol>
								<h3>Impact</h3>
								<p>The initiative had several key outcomes:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Created interactive learning experiences that catered to a diverse student population, enhancing engagement in both the Open Access and Flex Term sections.</li>
									<li>Improved course completion rates and student satisfaction through gamified elements and accessible, user-friendly design.</li>
									<li>Contributed to the scalability and flexibility of Carleton's online courses, supporting thousands of learners globally while meeting academic requirements for credit-seeking students.</li>
